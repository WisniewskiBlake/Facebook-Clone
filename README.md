# Facebook-Clone
This is a Facebook clone that I made for mobile. It supports multiple users, live news feed, friends, notifications, and customizable user profile pages. 

To run this app you need to download Xampp here https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html. 

The database can be created using the code I left in the "database" folder. The php in the "php" folder can be utilized in any text editor. Don't forget to substitute your details in.
